### GraphQL Learning

I've been interested on GraphQL for a while now, so this project is where I practice and learn a little bit of it.

These are the steps I'll take in order to learn a little bit more about GraphQL:

1. How can I make a simple CRUD (w/o database connection) in GraphQL using mutations and queries?

2. How do I connect to a database?

3. How do I do user authentication?

4. How do I connect to external data sources?

I'll try to tackle these one step at a time.

Just for the record, I will be using Apollo rather than `express-graphql` because apollo lets us use
something called **GraphQL Playground** to test out our queries, express-graphql also provides us a GUI to test queries called
GraphiQL, but GraphQL Playground has a nicer UI.
